If you don't take care of him he will go out of control and either become insanely obese, or frighteningly ripped. Obviously, we don't want either of these to occur to our Bod, so we must remain vigilant. Designing Your Bod Those who don't get in on the initial DadBod mint can still access the game by purchasing a Bod. People who purchase a Bod can design it in any way they want: Choose their hair color and style, facial hair color and style, skin color, etc. Fresh Bods will have generic items, but players can go deck out their Bod at the shop described in Items . To keep Bods separate from DadBods, and because we believe in segregation of the elite, Bods will not have the golden ear mentioned in DadBodNFT . The Dailies Take care of your Bod consistently to make sure you don't lose that prime shape. You don't want a GodBod. Save that for the afterlife. You don't want a PotatoBod. Gotta keep up with the wifey. You want.. you need the DadBod. Every day you will drift further from the perfect bod. This must be prevented. Login daily to keep your bod on track. Details This is the DadBod Conditioning Bar, or the DadBod Bar: Your Bod will drift towards the end it is closest to. For example, let's say your bod is here on the DadBod Bar: and you leave your Bod alone for too long, he will end up with the PotatoBod, which looks like this: Likewise, if you are slightly too shredded and your DadBod Bar is here: your Bod will end up working out far too much. As we can see, Bods appear to polarize their health. We aren't sure why. Haven't figured that out yet. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to prevent both the GodBod and the PotatoBod. Log in each day and rip those potato chips out of his hands, if he's too fat. Get him off the treadmill if he's too godlike. Keep the dad bod. The Minigames You can play minigames whenever you want. Your ability to play each minigame will be a function of how close to the center of the DadBod Bar you are. The closer to the perfect bod, the better your Bod will perform. Minigames will be anything from racing to the hotdog stand, rolling down a hill, cooking for the company, and fighting through the grocery store to get what your wife asked you to find. Be ready for anything. Unranked Unranked game modes will not give you any crypto in return. They are meant for practice and fun between friends. Ranked Ranked game modes will give crypto to the winners. This mode will pit players against eachother. May the best bod win.","title":"Gameplay"},{"location":"Gameplay/#gameplay","text":"DadBod is a game in which you take care of your Bod.

They can be equipped to a Bod, and if a Bod is sold or transferred, the items will go with that Bod. When items are equipped to a Bod, the image of that Bod is updated to reflect that. There are two kinds of Items: Original Copy Original Items are those that come with a DadBod NFT. They are slightly different visually from the copied version. Copied Items are those purchased from the shop in game. Gameplay As of right now, Items have no impact on stats within the game. The DadBod Shop Items can be purchased from the in game shop using crypto. We are still working out the details on this. Utility Items function similary to DadBods, but because there are less of them, the funds are split up among fewer people. In the item shop in game, people can purchase items for their Bod. Each time an item is purchased, the 20% of the funds are split up among the owners of that Item.
