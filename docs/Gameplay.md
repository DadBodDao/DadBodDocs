# DadBod Gameplay
DadBod is a game in which you take care of your Bod. If you don't take care of him he will go out of control and either become insanely obese, or frighteningly ripped.

Obviously, we don't want either of these to occur to our Bod, so we must remain vigilant.

## The Dailies
Take care of your Bod consistently to make sure you don't lose that prime shape.  
You don't want a GodBod. Save that for the afterlife.  
You don't want a PotatoBod. Gotta keep up with the wifey.  
You want.. you **need** the DadBod.  

Every day you will drift further from the perfect bod.  
This must be prevented.  
Login daily to keep yourself on track.  

### Details
This is the DadBod Conditioning Bar, or the DadBod Bar:

Your Bod will drift towards the end it is closest to.  
For example, let's say your bod is here on the DadBod Bar:
![DadBodBar_3_4](Assets/DadBodBar_3_4.png)
and you leave your Bod alone for too long, he will end up with the PotatoBod, which looks like this:

Likewise, if you are slightly too shredded and your DadBod Bar is here:

your Bod will end up working out far too much.  
  
As we can see, Bods appear to polarize their health more than politicians do to America.  
  
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to prevent both the GodBod and the PotatoBod.
Log in each day and rip those potato chips out of his hands, if he's too fat. Get him off the treadmill if he's too godlike. Keep the dad bod.
