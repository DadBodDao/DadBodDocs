Each DadBod will have a golden ear, which will set him apart from all the other Bods roaming the game.  
DadBod genetics are static and will be locked at the time of mint. You cannot change them.
DadBod items are dynamic: You can unequip the ones he comes with and equip different ones when you acquire them in the game.  

## DadBod Utility
Anyone can purchase access to DadBod by buying a Bod to play with.  
DadBods provide automatic access to the game. An automatic, beautiful, Bod.   
When someone purchases access to the game, 20% of that purchase will be split among all DadBod NFT holders.  
Each DadBod represents a fraction of that 20%.  

Example:

- I own 2 DadBods  
- 1000 people buy a Bod for 10 KDA, so 10000 KDA is spent buying Bods.  
- 2000 KDA is sent to DadBod holders  
- I receive `(2/9001) * 2000 = 0.444` KDA  

## Items
Each DadBod minted will also come with at least 1 item, unless they are from the whitelisted pool, in which case they are fully clothed.
