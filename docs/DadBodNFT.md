## DadBod Utility
Anyone can purchase access to DadBod by buying a Bod to play with.  
DadBods provide automatic access to the game. An automatic, beautiful, Bod.   
When someone purchases access to the game, 20% of that purchase will be split among DadBod NFT holders.  
Each DadBod represents a fraction of that 20%.  

Example:

- I own 2 DadBods  
- 1000 people buy a Bod for 10 KDA, so 10000 KDA is spent buying Bods.  
- 2000 KDA is sent to DadBod holders  
- I receive `(2/9001) * 2000 = 0.444` KDA  

## Items
Each DadBod minted will also come with at least 1 item, unless they are from the whitelisted pool, in which case they are fully clothed.
